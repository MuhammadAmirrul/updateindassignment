<p class="p1" style="text-align:center;color:DarkSlateGray"><span style="cursor:default">In this page, I'm gonna shared with you my journey as a university student. I am a student of Diploma in Library Management (IM120) from Faculty of Information Management in University Technology MARA (UiTM) Kedah and I'm now still in my 4th semester. To be honest, this is not my first choice because I placed it in the sixth choice when applying for admission to university, yet I remain grateful to have the opportunity to continue my studies to university. This course were actually out of my expectation because I thought we will only learned about how to arranging a book and how to managing a library, but apparently it was harder than I expected &#128514 Library Management actually was a great course because students will also learned about others subject such as we had learned about managing an organization, editing with multimedia, software, non-verbal communication, promotional, marketing, business and many more! This course also suitable for anyone who did not like mathematics because there are 100% NO MATH! &#129322 I think that is all the briefing about my courses. Now, lets take a look about what I have been through over these four semesters &#128513</span><br></p>

  <h2>FIRST SEMESTER</h2>
  <p>In my first semester, I sometimes think that I am still lost and did not know my direction for success after high school. With a course that were not my first choices, and also with myself that was an introvert person and need to meet with new people. I am not ready for this. However, I manage to overcome all of that! I'm still remember when the first time I got into the campus, the first person that I knew was my roommate. I tried my best to overcome my weakness when meeting a new people. Beside that, the interim week helped me a lot, I was able to improve my level of communication with others, what helped me the most was my very supportive classmates. We worked together, brainstorming, and give out all of our ideas for our task during the interim week. It was a great beginning for my diploma journey. After that, on the first week of class, our academic club which is Association of Library Management (ALiM) has called out all IM120 students to be a part of their committee. At that time, I believe it was one of the best ways for me to gain confidence, so I offered myself to participate in the interview. Surprisingly, I was elected to the club's committee as the sports exco. Not only that, but I also participated in a Program Siswa Sihat (PROSIS) club interview and was admitted as vice treasurer. This has slowly changed me, and I am now more eager to collaborate in communities. Anyway, my first semester as a Library Management student also was not really easy because this is my first time knowing about library's work. But I'm doing fine because I got many seniors that were so kind in helping us, moreover my groupmates for group project are so function and we can get along together. From first until fourth semester, I can say that first semester is the best for me because I gain so many good memories with my classmates, roommates, seniors, lecturers, and everyone that I knew in the campus!</p>

  <h2>SECOND SEMESTER</h2>
  <p>My second semester was not really good for me but I can still get through it. It was very cheerful as normal in the first third week. I was able to run a university programme, go out with friends, and meet more new people. I remember in the third week, I got a chance to do a successful zumba program with the PROSIS Club. We practiced almost every day and I also can't believe I managed to get rid of the nervousness of dancing on the stage where hundreds of people were watching me.However, when the world was affected by the Covid-19 disease, all of us were forced to return to our homes, and we all had to study online to this day because face-to-face studying is still prohibited. Well, online class or Online Distance Learning (ODL) was not easy as most people thought. There are many student suffered a lot during this first online class even among of my friends. At that time, I was able to know my friends better, some people that always look happy-go-lucky is actually having a mental breakdown, broken family, and also depression. I took this as my responsibility to make them feels better. I tried my best to give a good advice, cheering them, and also prevented them than doing anything dangerous. My second semester was also a tough semester for me. For my course, we need to learn about editing using a multimedia software, it was not easy since we need to use UiTM facilities for a better work than casual laptop. Most of my coursemates was really having a hard time to get the software in our laptop because the software need a high requirements. Not gonna lie that I've spend over RM1000 just to upgrade and repair my laptop. But I think there are more student who got more problem than me, that is the reason why I'm still grateful. Anyway, what is the best in the second semester is I can helped many people who is really suffering in many ways. And what make me proud is I can helped some of my classmate in understanding the multimedia subject because I really loves that subject and make me more easy to understanding and helps the others. Nearly end of the semester, there are one thing happened that really changed me until this day, I have been elected as the president of the academic club of my course, ALiM Club. At first, I don't want to accept it because I can't believe in myself, but the ex-president, Ainol, keep engenders in me the confidence that I am deserving of the position. I accepted the position after giving it some thought, and I began working on the role during my semester break, with a lot of support from Ainol and other seniors.</p>

  <h2>THIRD SEMESTER</h2>
  <p>I am doing well in my third semester, I guess?? It was my first time being the president of the club! It's kinda thrilling for me but with the help of everyone I managed to did it well. After half of the semester, I thought that I can't make it for my academic. Why? because there are one subject that scared me a lot. Cataloging subject or I just called it killer subject hahahahaha my first thought was that I would fail this subject. However, with the help of my senior and classmates especially Ainol and Dayana, finally I can master this subject day by day and got grade B as the result which its really make me proud as the result from my struggle and not giving up first. Anyway, the 3rd semester in my course is the semester where we will having our practical in any public or academic library. I was so excited about it because I've wait for it from my first semester. But something happended that couldn't make me going for practical that time due to the problem with the rules in pandemic that time, and also my place are still red zone that time. Despite that, I still accept it and I will do a practical in this 4th semester. So wish me good luck for my practical soon! Along the period of my 3rd semester, I learned so much about leadership skill since this is my first time being a leader for the whole course. I am so happy that I got so many positive feedback from students in handling them very well &#128420</p>

  <h2>FOURTH SEMESTER</h2>
  <p>Fourth semester or my current semester, yes I'm still going through it. So far everything are just fine and I'm getting better at prioritising my time for academics, club activities, and personal affairs. I'm still hoping that everything will always be in good just like now until the end of my semester. Sometimes its just feel sad because I will graduated from a diploma student very soon. Graduating from universities was my first step in achieving my dream. I wish for the best in the future for myself, my friends, and my family &#128171</p>
